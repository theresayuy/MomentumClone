In 2021, I attempted to mock the Momentum Google Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JS to expand my web development experience. I stopped working on the HTML, CSS, and JS version of this project to attempt to learn React, Node.js and other web development technologies and to attempt to use something other than localStorage to store the todo list and bookmarks list. This program is unfinished. I decided to save the code here because it contains many resources that I might want to carry over.
